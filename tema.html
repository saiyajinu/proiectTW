                        shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Microsoft Windows. First teased under the
                        codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on
                        April 7, 2020, followed by an official release on June 2, 2020. The development of the game
                        started in 2014. Valorant takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series of tactical shooters,
                        borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while moving.

            <div class="textimagistica">Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter set in the near
                future. Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters designed based on several
                countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the
                attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each
                requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths,
                orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature
                ability" charges. Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system
                that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for,
                and any objectives completed.</div>

                that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately. It currently offers 19 agents

                           Valorant, like many other competitive shooters, has become active within esports. Riot Games
                    decided to create the first tournament called "First Strike" to establish a foundation for an
                    esports scene to be created with the game. In November 2020, Riot Games announced the tournament
                    series called VALORANT Champions Tour (VCT) which is a year-long competition consisting of three
                    levels: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>VALORANT Challengers - regional competitions which are qualifiers for Masters</li>
                        <li>VALORANT Masters - international competitions in mid-season, divided into many stages</li>
                        <li>VALORANT Champions - the world championship of the year</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Teams will qualify directly for Champions via top places in Circuit Point Standings of their region,
                    based on results of Challengers and Masters. Teams who are at middle places in Circuit Point
                    Standings will have one more chance to qualify for Champions by winning the Last Chance Qualifiers
                    (North America, EMEA, South America, Asia Pacific).</p>
